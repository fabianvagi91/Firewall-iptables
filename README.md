Linux Firewall using iptables

During the course of my studies i learn about network security and how important is to take mesurements in securing our network.
So for my fist project i choose to build a simple but efective firewall in my kali linux virtual machine.
A firewall is a subsystem on a computer that blocks or allow certain network traffic from going into or out of our computer.

I choose iptables due to its user frendliness and because its a long standing framework which is secure and flexible.
